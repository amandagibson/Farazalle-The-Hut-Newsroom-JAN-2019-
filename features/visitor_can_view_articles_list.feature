	Scenario: View list of articles on the landing page
		Given I visit the "landing" page
		Then I should see "Great articles! This site's popularity is raising so quick!" for "The Hub News is the site of the moment"
		And I should see "Researchers are running clinical studies to see the benefits of cinnamon buns consumption. Some..." for "Eating cinnamon buns increases life expectancy"
		But I should not see "state that it might be correlated with an increase in life expectancy, is that really true?" for "Eating cinnamon buns increases life expectancy"
		And I should not see "Great articles! This site's popularity is raising so quick!" for "Spring hasn't arrived in Sweden yet"
